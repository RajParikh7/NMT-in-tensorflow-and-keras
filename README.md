# NMT-in-tensorflow-and-keras
Here I have Implemented google's NMT in tensorflow and keras. Implemented Luong attention and beam search with width-3 on top of NMT model.
Finally bleu score is calculated to gauge the accuracy of the model. I have set epochs to 100, because dataset was small and it gave me good accuracy( also had computation constraints), you can increase the epochs and beam-width for better accuracy.
